When the snow melted away
Yet my world frozen and grey
You brought me the seeds
And buried them deep in me
“Holy land, with Her we stand”
The love we teach, violence we preach
“Knives in hand, we're innocent lambs”
Don't you see?
All of these pretences are petty ironies
Huh
They say
You'll never be erased
You still live inside me, inside me
"Whose life are you offering?"
Paint me red, oh paint me red
"Whose life are you offering?"
My hands are red, my heart is black
Lalala…
I cried
I screamed
I slept
I woke up mad
Counting blessings we could have
I tried to defy the rules dividing us
In blood we trust
You're gone like the wind
Chasing you, I breathed in deep
Swallowing the dust that used to be part of you
Duetting solo to your lonely vaguely beautiful
melody
